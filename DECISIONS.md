# Decisions

- Phase 1: secp256k1 uses affine coordinates with `pow(x, -1, p)`; fast enough (<20 ms per operation).
- Phase 1: config validation of `node_rpc` uses urllib.parse; ports and paths are allowed, userinfo is not checked.
- Phase 3: GeoDB keeps IPv4 ranges in array('I'); a (runner, slot) conflict is detected via INSERT OR IGNORE. Country table maps TF to AN, UM to NA.

## Phase 4
- `RpcChain.block_at_time` reads genesis first (0 if later than ts), then binary-searches up to the tip.
- `get_cells` stops at the first empty page or a missing/empty cursor.
- Registry: a cell whose out_point cannot be parsed counts as invalid; opt-in changes count as "updated".

## Phase 5
- Push slot closing keeps a per-runner "next slot to close" mark; slots at or after the slot of an open challenge are not closed until it is answered or expires. Missed push slots are recorded with ts = slot start.
- Push responses are recorded with the check-in time as `ts`; a late (but still open) answer is recorded as `late`.
- `unknown_tip` also applies when the chain cannot return a hash for the runner's tip; a missing expected block hash gives `wrong_block_hash`.
- Transport errors in pull probes: socket timeouts → `timeout`, everything else → `unreachable`. Exceptions from a probe thread (e.g. local node RPC down) skip that probe instead of recording a miss.

## Phase 8
- Ranking and summary are computed together and cached per day for 30 s; the runner detail reuses the cached ranking (rank/score/asn_peers).
- Runner detail 404s `unknown_runner` for non-active runners; history likewise.
- Non-`/v1/` paths return a plain `404 not_found` JSON until Phase 9 adds the page.
- A check-in body larger than 16384 bytes is rejected with 413 (the server reads at most 16385 bytes and closes the connection).
- Non-200 prober replies are passed through as-is with their status.

## Phase 9
- Static files are served only for GET; `/` and `/static/<name>` bypass the rate limiter and `/v1/` check. Cache-Control: no-cache.
- Page "ranked" count uses `runner_count`; ASN diversity shown from `diversity_index`.
- Map is a 19-column CSS grid; tile intensity scales with the country's share of the max count.
